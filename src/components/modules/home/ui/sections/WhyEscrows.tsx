            Why Escrows Matter
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-6">
            At its core, an escrow is a neutral and secure way to hold funds
            while something else happensâ€”whether it's transferring a house,
            delivering a product, or completing a project.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-6">
            In traditional payment systems, trust is built through costly
            intermediaries, complex processes, and limited transparency. These
            barriers slow innovation, increase costs, and limit accessibility.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-medium">
            Trustless Work eliminates these inefficiencies, fostering trust
            through blockchain-powered automation, API-driven simplicity, and
            global accessibility.
