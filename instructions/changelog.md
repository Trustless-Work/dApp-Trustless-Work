### Refactor: Improved Escrow Service Architecture and Type Safety

#### PR Description
This PR introduces significant architectural improvements to the escrow service layer, enhancing type safety, maintainability, and performance. The changes follow industry best practices and establish a more robust foundation for the escrow functionality.

#### Key Improvements

##### Architecture & Organization
- Separated concerns between types, services, and state management
- Moved shared types to centralized `@types` directory
- Established clear boundaries between data layer and business logic
- Improved code organization following domain-driven design principles

##### Type Safety
- Consolidated duplicate type definitions
- Enhanced type definitions using TypeScript utility types (Omit, Pick)
- Improved type consistency for numeric values stored as strings
- Added proper type imports with explicit 'type' imports

##### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented proper function memoization using useCallback
- Fixed React hooks dependency arrays
- Added request deduplication in data fetching
- Improved state updates efficiency

##### Code Quality
- Removed duplicate code and redundant interfaces
- Enhanced code readability with proper formatting
- Added proper error handling for async operations
- Improved type conversions for balance handling

#### Technical Details
- Refactored `EscrowPayload` to use TypeScript's utility types
- Consolidated balance handling logic with proper type conversions
- Improved hook dependencies in `escrow-detail-dialog.hook.ts`
- Enhanced service layer with proper type definitions

#### Impact
- Reduced potential for runtime errors through enhanced type safety
- Improved maintainability through better code organization
- Enhanced performance through proper memoization and state management
- Better developer experience with clearer type definitions

#### Breaking Changes
None. All changes are backward compatible.

#### Migration
No migration needed. Changes are transparent to existing implementations.
